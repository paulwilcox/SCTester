Note that this package is still in version 0.  In other
words, it probably won't work unless you're really keeping 
up with what I'm doing.  

Don't worry, I'll try to have this usable soon.

## Description

Just a simple testing tool to test javascript functions in both 
the client and server environments without having to write 
code for each.  

- Works on the console.
- Output is in table form
- Output includes execution time.

## Example

    node scTester --td ./tests --port 8082

## History

This project started with some server-side and puppeteer code 
and eventually started turning into a framework of sorts.  I 
decided to make a library out of it.
