Just a simple testing tool to test javascript functions in both 
the client and server environments without having to write 
code for each.  

Gives execution time output.

This project presently evolves to fit the needs of projects 
created by paul wilcox.  If the project has features that you
feel are worthy for your own use, and you would like to consider
it for your own project, put in an "issue" and let me know.

I'll then be prompted to develop the project with this in mind.
